# D3-challenge

Creating a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age.
Using the D3 techniques taught in class, creating a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. 

This will be coded in the app.js file and will pull in the data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function.

State abbreviations will be included in the circles.
